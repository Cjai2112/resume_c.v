                    <p class="about-me-contents">
 I’m a friendly, determined individual that is passionate about tech and AWS although I’m relatively new to the world of tech I can not get enough! I am highly motivated to absorb as much knowledge as I can and am inspired by both female and male industry leaders. Although I only started my AWS and I.T journey December 2021 I know it’s perfect for me, it’s an ever changing world that  I can thrive in. I’m a problem solver at heart, that is my core skill! I see a problem and I will fix it.  My every spare moment has been to study and get hands on to the technical aspects of AWS and I love the fact I can never learn enough I attend every session with-in the AWS Academy being taught by the great Andy Bell-Dean, Andy Cooper, Stefan Buse, Bhavik Sadjid, Jack Lavell, being in a fantastic community that breeds greatness has been so beneficial to me and my progress. I’m not just passionate for I.T I’m passionate for the community, I love to help and loved my job as a carer for the elderly and I've loved every second of raising my children. I will always go above and beyond to be helpful and supportive. 
I work well Individually and in a team I am highly motivated and extremely motivating. I have excellent communication skills and a broad out of the box thought process.
